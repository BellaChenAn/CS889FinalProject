# CS889FinalProject
This is the source code for the CS889 final project, which you can review directly. However, to fully reproduce the project, you’ll need to install Unity, Max, and Arduino, as well as have hardware support. I have also created an alternative version that does not require any hardware and can be operated using only a computer keyboard.

The voiceover was performed by the author. Other sound effects were obtained from the FreeSound website: https://freesound.org. Most of the 3D models were sourced from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/, while the environment models were created by the author using Cinema 4D.
