# CS889FinalProject
This is the source code for the CS889 final project, which you can review directly. However, to fully reproduce the project, youâ€™ll need to install Unity, Max, and Arduino, as well as have hardware support. I have also created an alternative version that does not require any hardware and can be operated using only a computer keyboard.
